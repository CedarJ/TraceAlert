Xilin Huang(a1779212) was responsible for bluetooth advertising, scanning functions, as well as QR code generating and scanning functions.

I've averagely spent 10.1 hour per week on this course.

I wrote minutes for second and fifth client meeting.

For Milestone 1, I mainly implemented the bluetooth scanning function and advertising function. I've also implemented the geolocating function for the phone to locate itself and add the location information when there are any new contact to database. The function is in TraceAlert/client/www/js/bluetooth.js.

For Final Milestone, I implemented the QR code generating function and QR code scanning function for users to scan their contactsâ€˜ QR code and also add their location information into database. Th function is in TraceAlert/client/www/js/scan.js. I've also designed the user interface of camera scanning page.
