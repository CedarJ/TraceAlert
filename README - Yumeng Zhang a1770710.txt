On average, I spent 11 hours on this course every week.

We have been taking turns writing meeting agendas and minutes.
I wrote the agenda for the second and fourth client meeting and the minutes for the second client meeting.

At the project preparation stage, I initialised the Cordova project and created the directory structure on GitHub.

For iteration 1, I was responsible for creating a server and setting up the database, so I coded for all of the functions in "TraceAlert/client/www/js/firebase.js" and the functions related to manipulating the database in "TraceAlert/server/index.js". I also initialised Firebase project and the relevant services.

For iteration 2, I performed unit testing for some of my database interaction functions and integration testing for the rest of the database related functions. The code used for unit testing can be found in "Testing files and results". I also re-developed the front-end user interface so I wrote the majority of the code in "TraceAlert/client/www/index.html", "TraceAlert/client/www/js/index.js", "TraceAlert/client/www/js/navigation.js" and "TraceAlert/client/www/css/index.css".
